Networking
Create an application where clients connect to a server in order to form a social network. The application will contain two parts (create a project for each one):

The server is responsible with the management of the clients and the implementation of the services.
The client will communicate with the server, sending it commands containing the name of the service and the required parameters. The commands are:
register name: adds a new person to the social network;
login name: establishes a connection between the server and the client;
friend name1 name2 ... namek: adds friendship relations between the person that sends the command and other persons;
send message: sends a message to all friends.
read: reads the messages from the server.
The main specifications of the application are:

Compulsory (1p)

- [x] Create the project for the server application.
- [x] Implement the class responsible with the creation of a ServerSocket running at a specified port. The server will receive requests (commands) from clients and it will execute them.
- [x] Create a class that will be responsible with communicating with a client Socket. The communication will be on a separate thread. If the server receives the command stop it will stop and will return to the client the respons "Server stopped", otherwise it return: "Server received the request ... ".
- [x] Create the project for the client application.
- [x] A client will read commands from the keyboard and it will send them to the server. The client stops when it reads from the keyboard the string "exit".


Homework (2p)
- [x] Create an object-oriented model for your application and implement the commands.
  The command stop should "gracefully" stop the server - it will not accept new games but it will finish those in progress. When there are no more games, it will shutdown.
- [x] Implement a timeout for a connection (a number of minutes). If the server does not receive any command from a logged in client in the specified period of time, it will terminate the connection.
- [] (+0.5p) Create a SVG representation of the social network, using Apache Batik, or other technology.
- [] (+0.5p) Upload a HTML document containing the social network representation directly from the application to a Web server. You may use JCraft for connecting to a server using SFTP and transferring a file (or a similar solution).


Bonus (2p+)

- [] Create a command that returns various properties of the social network. You may use JGraphT or other library.
- [] Using a maximum network flow algorithm, determine the structural cohesion of the network. You may want to read this (combinatorial applications of network flows).
